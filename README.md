# A Data-Driven Approach to AI and Python

## Project Summary

In this project, you will step into the crucial role of a data scientist here at Transformational AI tasked with supporting machine learning model development. Your mission (should you choose to accept it, and we hope that you do) is to analyze and transform large datasets and to provide valuable insights for the company's machine learning team.

Throughout the project, you will:

* Set up a Python environment using Jupyter Notebooks.
* Utilize libraries like pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn to manipulate and visualize data.
* Perform data transformation and export cleaned datasets in .csv and .parquet formats for further analysis and machine learning model training.
* Generate insightful visualizations and summaries to help the business team identify top-performing products in the electronics category.
* Apply Pythonic concepts that will reinforce your knowledge in preparation for the PCEP exam.

The project emphasizes hands-on learning, with tasks structured to gradually build your expertise in data science workflows, while introducing advanced language and concepts. The end goal is to prepare a dataset that will help the machine learning team fine-tune their models and enhance customer satisfaction analysis.
