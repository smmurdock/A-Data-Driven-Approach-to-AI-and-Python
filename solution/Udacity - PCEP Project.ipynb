    "# Transformational AI: Analyzing Ecommerce Large Datasets for Machine Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to your journey as a data scientist at Transformational AI, where you will play a pivotal role in shaping the future of our company's machine learning models. In this project, you will leverage two Amazon Reviews 2023 datasets, originally sourced from Hugging Face, to perform data transformation, analysis, and visualization. Through this notebook, you will gain hands-on experience with pandas DataFrames and explore powerful data visualization techniques using `seaborn` and `matplotlib`. You will also learn to export your cleaned and processed data into `.csv` and `.parquet` formats, ready for advanced machine learning tasks. Get ready to dive into the world of data science and make impactful contributions to our machine learning team by preparing top-quality datasets for model fine-tuning and customer satisfaction analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "Do not worry if this sounds like a lot right now. Transformational AI makes no mistakes and we hired you for a reason. We will take this one step at a time, and know you have our full support every step of the way. We will be using a lot of advanced language and words, which will add to your Pythonic knowledge and background, while, reinforcing core concepts that you will need to know for your upcoming PCEP exam.\n",

    "\n",
    "- `datasets`: Providres access to a wide range of datasets, including the Amazon Reviews 2023 dataset we'll be using.\n",
    "- `pandas`: A powerful data manipulation and analysis library that makes working with structured data easy with Python.\n",
    "- `matplotlib`: A comprehensive library for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python.\n",
    "- `seaborn`: Built on top of matplotlib, seaborn provides a high-level interface for drawing attractive and informative statistical graphics, great for visualizing trends from data.\n",
    "- `pyarrow`: A fast and efficient library for reading and writing data in the Apache Arrow format, like Parquet and Feather, to handle large amounts of data efficiently.\n",

The first column is technically an index, which provides a unique numeric identifier to each row so that the row itself can be filtered. The `rating` column expresses a float value ranging from 1.0 to 5.0, so this is a ordinal categorical data type. It presents as a float rather than an integer, possibly because aggregates would present as floats. The `title` column is the title of the review as set by the reviewer, so this is a text column. The `text` column is the full text review as written by the product reviewer. The `images` column allows for a list of nested metadata related to the attached image(s) if there is one, otherwise there is an empty list present. The `asin` and `parent_asin` columns are alphanumeric identifiers that likely identify what category of products the individual product belongs to; these are nominal categorical variables. The `user_id` is also a unique alphanumeric identifier that allows one product reviewer to leave more than one product review but be unique to each individual. The `timestamp` offers data on when the review was left (although further detail may be needed on how this is measured because it does not look typical of datetime data). The `helpful_vote` column is a discrete integer value that allows readers of product reviews to indicate affirmatively if the product review was helpful to their product research. Lastly, the `verified_purchase` column is a Boolean value that indicates whether a reviewer is verified as having purchased the product; this helps purchasers know that the product review is legitimate.\n",

    "Now that you are working with DataFrames and large datasets in Python, let's analyze our data a bit before moving on to the next section. Data analysis usually involves reviewing, investigating, or looking up specific information within the larger data context. However, this can lead to errors, especially if the data isn't formatted correctly, if data is missing, or if outputs aren't always consistent. As we work with Python, we will want to ensure our work remains robust and error-free at Transformational AI.\n",

    "- Display the DataFrame: We'll display the sorted DataFrame as a table.\n",
    "- Create a Scatterplot: We'll create a scatterplot to visualize the relationship between price and average rating for the highly rated products.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### STEPS TO COMPLETE:\n",
    "- [X] Set the `highly_rated_products_df_cutoff` with the desired float threshold value\n",
    "- [X] Update the `highly_rated_products_df` to use the `.sort_values` method like you learned in class.\n",
    "- [X] Fill in the code to display the new sorted DataFrame\n",
    "- [X] Complete the code to create a scatterplot using Seaborn."
