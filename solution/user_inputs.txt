Transformational AI: Analyzing Ecommerce Large Datasets for Machine Learning

Question 1: There are ten columns of varying data types. This is confirmed by the (100 rows x 10 columns) statistic at the bottom left of the DataFrame. I mention this because DataFrame previews can be condensed when there are a lot of columns. The first column is technically an index, which provides a unique numeric identifier to each row so that the row itself can be filtered. The `rating` column expresses a float value ranging from 1.0 to 5.0, so this is a ordinal categorical data type. It presents as a float rather than an integer, possibly because aggregates would present as floats. The `title` column is the title of the review as set by the reviewer, so this is a text column. The `text` column is the full text review as written by the product reviewer. The `images` column allows for a list of nested metadata related to the attached image(s) if there is one, otherwise there is an empty list present. The `asin` and `parent_asin` columns are alphanumeric identifiers that likely identify what category of products the individual product belongs to; these are nominal categorical variables. The `user_id` is also a unique alphanumeric identifier that allows one product reviewer to leave more than one product review but be unique to each individual. The `timestamp` offers data on when the review was left (although further detail may be needed on how this is measured because it does not look typical of datetime data). The `helpful_vote` column is a discrete integer value that allows readers of product reviews to indicate affirmatively if the product review was helpful to their product research. Lastly, the `verified_purchase` column is a Boolean value that indicates whether a reviewer is verified as having purchased the product; this helps purchasers know that the product review is legitimate.
Question 2: I think this can be a helpful view but I'm more partial to `reviews_df.head()` without the `print()` command. While this version is not visually overstimulating with just the first five rows, it's difficult to read these column previews as part of a whole row. I prefer Jupyter Notebook's rich formatting and seeing all data printed in tabular form over this format.
Question 3: We changed the display settings within pandas to modify how all DataFrames appear when printed going forward. We set it to display all columns (versus a truncated list), set a larger display width within Jupyter Notebooks itself to take full advantage of the cell width, and set the maximum column width to give more of a preview for columns with more content, such as the text fields.
Question 4: The Reviews dataset had more information specific to the product review whereas the Reviews Metadata dataset has more data related to the product itself. This allows the product review data to be tied to specific products. There is significantly more data in the metadata with 16 columns (as opposed to 10 in the reviews data) with more mixtures of complex data types, including nested data that captures things like product images, product features, product specifications, etc.
Question 5: I find `df.head()` and `df.info()` to be the most helpful insight methods so far. `df.head()` lets you get a preview of actual data that a dataset captures, and `df.info()` allows you to get quick information like number of values, number of missing values, data types, etc that can help you determine how clean and complete the data is.
Question 6: The vast majority of the top products fall within an estimated $0-30 price range, with almost all of them falling under $200. There is one outlier around the $900-1000 price range. In general, most of the highest rated items are in the more affordable zone of under $200 where more people can afford to buy and review the products.
Question 7: There does not appear to be any correlation between price and rating. Most of the highly rated products are in the more affordable range of $0-200 with one outlier product around $900.
